Silicon Valley Network Graph:

I decided to make a network graph for the Silicon Valley TV show on HBO. I classified them by companies/groups in which they are present. 1. Piped Piper, 2. Housemates, 3. Investors, 4. Hooli (fake google) Company, and 5. Random Reoccurring Characters. They overlap a lot, and many characters know or have interacted with other characters, but not everyone knows everyone just yet. 


```{r}
library(networkD3)
library(magrittr)

link <- read.csv("sourceName.csv")
node <- read.csv("nameList.csv")
link
node
forceNetwork(Links = link, Nodes = node, Source = "source",
             Target = "target", 
             Value = "value", 
             NodeID = "name",
             Nodesize = "size",
             radiusCalculation = "Math.sqrt(d.nodesize)+6",
             Group = "group",
             fontSize = 15,
             opacity = 1, 
             legend = TRUE, 
             arrows = TRUE, 
             linkDistance = networkD3::JS("function(d) { return 130*d.value; }"),
             # mess number*d to get good distances. 
             zoom = T)



```
